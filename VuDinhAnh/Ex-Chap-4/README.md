# Simple ci for java repos

Note: ci = continuous integration

In order to make every exercise more connected (4-1, 4-2, 4-3, 4-5) of the book Introduction to Software Testing by Paul.A and Jeff.O,

I decided to create `simple-ci-for-java` repos and use it as a submodule to not mess up or create any conflict with [Dr Truong Anh Hoang's repos](https://github.com/truonganhhoang/Software-Testing-2020-USTH) and [My homework repos](https://github.com/dinhanhx/Software-Testing-2020-USTH).

This also enable me to be more flexible on creating project in IntelliJ IDEs
