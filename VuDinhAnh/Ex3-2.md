A simple inheritance hierarchy
```
+-----+
|  A  +<-----+
+--+--+      |
   ^         |
   |         |
+--+--+   +--+--+
|  B  |   |  D  |
+--+--+   +-----+
   ^
   |
+--+--+
|  C  |
+-----+
```

As we can see, class C inherited from class B, class B and class D inherited from Class A.

Therefore, there will be many protected and private variable as well as methods.

As a result, this makes programmer's life easier when they can reuse blueprints but this makes tester's life harder since this reduce controllability and observability.

Tester have to create an instance for each class and have to write driver code to make protected and private stuff more visible.

In above diagram, there 4 instances, imagine each of them have 3 private methods and 2 protected variables. They have to test at least 4 * 3 * 2 times.

They also have to test for consistency among instances or static methods if there are any.
