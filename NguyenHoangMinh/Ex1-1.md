1-1
Level 2 Thinking
Purpose is to show failures
Looking for failures is a negative activity
Puts testers and developers into an adversarial relationship
Level 4 Thinking
	A mental discipline that increases quality
Testing is only one way to increase quality
Test engineers can become technical leaders of the project
Primary responsibility to measure and improve software quality
Their expertise should help the developers
	This is the way “traditional” engineering works
So from those describe above we can think of some factors that would help a development organization move from Beizer’s testing level 2 (testing is to show errors) to testing level 4 (a mental discipline that increases quality)  like : 
	+ experience
	+ responsibility
	+ expertise
	+ technical
	+ skills 
	+ Good teamwork and communication to lead
