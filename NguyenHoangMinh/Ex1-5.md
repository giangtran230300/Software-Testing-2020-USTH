Program 1:
     a) The for-loop should be > or equal than 0
     b) Input : x=null; y=2
     c) For every input where y is in the second position, there will be no error.Example: x=[2 4 1]; y=3;
     d) For the input that no element in x = y, the program still print -1 but the error where its missing path is still there
     e) The error state: x=[2 3 5], y=2, i=0 return -1
     f) Change '>' to '> or equal than 0'.
     Program 2:
     a) The loop should start from the highest element and decrease.
     b) NO possible input
     c) Every input where there is no loop happen. Example : x = [9]
     d) x=[1 0 2]
     e) First state of error: x=[0 1 0] i=0 result return in  0
     f) Same as part a)
     Program 3:
     a) The condition should be '> than 0' not '> or equal'.
     b)Unless the array is empty otherwise the fault will be executed.
     c)Every arrays that does not have 0
     d) Every output that include 0 as a positive integer will also result in the failure of the program.
     e) The error state: x=[-4 2 0 2] i=2 count = 2
     f) Same as part a)
     Program 4
     a) If there is a negative odd number, it will not be count so add another condition where the remainder of x[i] divide by 2 equal -1.
     b) The fault will be executed as long as the x array is not empty
     c) Every array with input are all positive
     d) Any input with error also result in the failure since the program can not count the negative number as an odd number.
     e) Error state: x=[-3 -2 0 1 4], count = 0, i=0
     f) Same as a)
