2. Answer question (a) or (b), but not both, depending on your background.

(a) If you do, or have, worked for a software development company, how much effort did your
testing / QA team put into each of the four test activities? (test design, automation,
execution, evaluation)

(b) If you have never worked for a software development company, which of the four test
activities do you think you are best qualified for? (test design, automation, execution,
evaluation)

Answer:
(b) I think i fit with Test Design:
 - Test design is a document outlining the cases required in test cases
   + Demonstrate the test point of view, the cases required to cover Spec.
   + Short, easy to understand.
   + Easy to create a test: input -> output.
