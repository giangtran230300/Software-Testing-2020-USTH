aving a deep inheritance tree of classes could become more complex to test, because the sub classes are dependent of its father, that means, 
if we modify or update something in the super class, it will affect all its respective children, which means that every test affected by the 
modification have to be updated for the sub classes. Therefore, inheritance does not guarantee that a method tested in the context of the super 
class will work correctly or in the same way that in the context of the sub class or sub classes. Thus, this affects controllability because we 
will need to control every super class and its sub classes, and if wee have a deep inheritance tree, it will be very complicated. On the other hand, 
it affects observability becase we need to observe a large number of sub classes that actually are doing the same work as the super class.
