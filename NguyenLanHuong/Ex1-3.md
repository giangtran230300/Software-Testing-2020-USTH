# Ex1-3

What do we mean by “level 3 thinking is that the purpose of testing is to reduce risk?”

- It means that the to reveal faults is to limit disasters in the future.

What can the risks be?

- The cost can be little such as minor bugs that can be fixed in a few seconds.
- However, faults in software can result in the loss of millions of dollars or even human lives.

Can we reduce the risk to zero?

- Never, since it is impossible for human beings to think of all cases. However, it is software testers's job come up with as many cases as they can.
- User requirements are always changing, so is technology. Software needs to adapt and evolve overtime and risks are inevitable in that process.
