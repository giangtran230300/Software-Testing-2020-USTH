Inheritance in object-oriented programming can hinder controllability and observability. In some cases, a superclass has so many subclasses that it is hard to have a clear overview of the function and methods of each class. Moreover, methods can be overridden by a subclass, which makes it even harder to come up with test cases. 

However, with the help of an inheritance hierarchy, the developer can visualize the whole system of classes more easily. The would know where to start and what to keep in mind when design sets of test cases.
