# Ex2-2

I have never worked for a company, however I have tried testing for my group projects at the university. I think I am best qualified for execution and evaluation.

Test design is the hardest job since it takes someone with great knowledge about the code and a lot of experience.

Test automation is not suitable for me since I have little knowledge about test automation tools such as JUnit etc.

Execution and evaluation should be easy for me, I just have to do exactly what test designers and writers tell me to do.
