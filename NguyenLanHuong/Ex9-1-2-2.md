[This article](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305869980_Relating_Code_Coverage_Mutation_Score_and_Test_Suite_Reducibility_to_Defect_Density) examined how mutation score is related to coverage. It had concluded that traditional mutation score improves the relationship to defect density, but the characteristic of this indicator is still very much aligned with the overall code coverage.

Other articles such as:

[Andrews et al., 2006] suggested a strong positive correlation between the mutation score of a test set and the degree to which that test set detected actual faults. 

Just et al. [Just et al., 2014] confirmed these suggestions by first showing a strong relation between coverage satisfaction and fault detection, and then going even further by showing that moving from node (statement) coverage to edge (branch) coverage increased fault detection power, and moving from edge to mutation coverage increased fault detection power even more.
