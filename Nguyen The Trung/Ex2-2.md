In my opinion, the most qualified test activities is test design.<br>
First of all, criteria-base test design requires lot of programming knowledge, discrete math knowledge and testing knowledge.<br>
And not only that,  it requires much of a traditional CS degree.<br>
And if an organization uses people who are not qualified, they will spend time creating ineffective tests and be dissatisfied at work.<br>
Second of all, humand-base test design lot of knowledge about domain, testing and user interfaces.<br>
For people with these abilities, human-based test design is intellectually stimulating, rewarding, and challengingâ€“but often not to typical CS majors, who usually want to build
software!<br>
The main point is that the approaches are complementary and we need both to fully test software.<br>
