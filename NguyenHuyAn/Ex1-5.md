## (a) 
The if-test needs to take account of negative values (positive odd numbers are taken care
of by the second test):
if (x[i]%2 == -1 || x[i] > 0)

## (b) 
x must be either null or empty. All other inputs result in the fault being executed. We
give the empty case here.
Input: x = []
Expected Output: 0
Actual Output: 0

## (c) 
Any nonempty x with only non-negative elements works, because the first part of the
compound if-test is not necessary unless the value is negative.
Input: x = [1, 2, 3]
Expected Output: 3
Actual Output: 3

## (d) 
For this particular program, every input that results in error also results in failure. The
reason is that error states are not repairable by subsequent processing. If there is a
negative value in x, all subsequent states (after processing the negative value) will be
error states no matter what else is in x.

## (e) 
Input: x = [-3, -2, 0, 1, 4]
Expected Output: 3
Actual Output: 2
First Error State:
x = [-3, -2, 0, 1, 4]
i = 0;
count = 0;
