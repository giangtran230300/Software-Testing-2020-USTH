### Ex2-2
* (b) I have little experience and have never worked for a software development company so if the activity I think I'm best qualified for is Test Execution. 
According to the textbook, this activity can often be assigned to interns or employees with little technical background since nowadays there are testing tools can automatically 
run tests and record the results for us (IntelliJ for example). I also agree that we can't always depend on the tools, hand-executed tests required a lot of time and effort which 
makes the work become much harder.
