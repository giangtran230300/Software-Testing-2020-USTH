### Ex 3-2              
Inheritance hierarchy will affect both controllability and observability:
* Controllability: A hierarchy means that you have to deal with interconnected class which make things complicated as we will need to control every super class and its sub classes.
* Observability: At the same time observability is affected since we have to observe a large number of sub classes that actually are doing the same work as the super class.
