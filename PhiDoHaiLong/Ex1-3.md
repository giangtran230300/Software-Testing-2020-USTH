### Ex 1-3
* It means in level 3, testers and developers realize that risk is always existed so they want reduce the risk since risk may be catastrophic
* The risk here is things may go wrong when we use the software, happen when we use the software
* Risk cant be reduced to zero first the word 'reduce' is used instead of 'eliminate' which means eliminate risk is impossible, in our life any thing we do carries some degree of risk
