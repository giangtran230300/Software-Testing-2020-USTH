### Ex 9-2-2 + 9-2-3

#### a) If possible, find test inputs that do not reach the mutant.
* findVal: The mutant is always reached, even if x = null.  
* sum: If x is null or the empty array, ie x = null or [], then the mutant is never
reached.

#### b) If possible, find test inputs that satisfy reachability but not infection for the mutant.
* findVal: Infection always occurs, even if x = null, because i always has the
wrong value after initialization in the loop.
* sum: Any input with all zeroes will reach but not infect. Examples are: x = [0]
or [0, 0].

#### c) If possible, find test inputs that satisfy reachability and infection, but not propagation for the mutant.
* findVal: As long as the last occurrence of val isn’t at numbers[0], the correct
output is returned. Examples are: (numbers, val) = ([1, 1], 1) or ([-1,
1], 1) or (null, 0).
* sum: Any input with nonzero entries, but with a sum of zero, is fine. Examples
are: x = [1, -1] or [1, -3, 2].

#### d) If possible, find test inputs that strongly kill the mutants.
* findVal: Any input with val only in numbers[0] works. An example is: (numbers,
val) = ([1, 0], 1).
* sum: Any input with a nonzero sum works. An example is: x = [1, 2, 3].
