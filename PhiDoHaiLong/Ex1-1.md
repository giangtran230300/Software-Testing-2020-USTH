### Ex 1-1
In order for an organization moving from Beizer's testing level 2 to testing level 4 they need:
* level 2 testing puts testers and developers into an adversarial relationship while level 4 testing need the testers and developers are on the same team so the first factor is teamwork
* in order to improve teamwork we need to solve the existing conflict between testers and developers
* we need to change/improve mindset of both testers and developers, improve abilities of both testers and developers
