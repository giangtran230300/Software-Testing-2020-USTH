### Ex 3-5
The assertion only checks a the first element in the list. So if a test causes a fault to infect, and then propagate to
another part of the final state, the failure will not be revealed. To correct we need to look at the entire list.
* Reachability: The test can only reach the fault if it is the first element.
* Infection: The first element can be incorrect.
* Propagation: If the first element is infected then it cannot propagate but other cases can make the fault propagate to another part.
* Revealability: Can only reveal the failure if the the first element is incorrect.
