Give a one-to-two paragraph explanation for how the inheritance
hierarchy can affect controllability and observability.

A complex and long inheritance tree could be harder to maintain and more complex
to test. The sub classes of an inheritance tree are dependent of its parents. If 
we were to test the super class, the test would not be guaranteed to success in 
the preceding classes, and have to create individual tests for the sub classes. 
Controllability is the ability to control the super classes, and their sub classes. 
Observability is the act of viewing a work functioned the same for all classes 
in the hierarchy. The controllability and observability 
is being affected because of the structure of an inheritance hierarchy, being that 
the sub classes can be overrided and overloaded.
