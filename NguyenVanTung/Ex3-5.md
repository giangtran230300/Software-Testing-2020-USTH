The following JUnit test method for the sort() method has a non-
syntactic flaw. Find the flaw and describe it in terms of the RIPR
model. Be as precise, specific, and concise as you can. For full
credit, you must use the terminology introduced in the book.
In the test method, names is an instance of an object that stores
strings and has methods add(), sort(), and getFirst(),
which do exactly what you would expect from their names.

* Reachability

 The fault is reached **names.getFirst().equals("Alex")**
* Infection

 Execution of the fault leads to an incorrect program state (error) **The test is always true**
* Propagation

 The infected state must cause the program output or final state to
be incorrect (failure) 
* Revealability

 The tester must observe part of the incorrect portion of the
program state
