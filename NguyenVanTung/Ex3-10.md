Replace each occurrence of a set with a list in the JUnit theory
removeThenAddDoesNotChangeSet. Is the resulting theory
valid or invalid? How many of the tests that pass the precondition
also pass the postcondition? Explain.

The theory would be invalid if the data is repeated.
All tests passed.

A Set in Java is a collection with unique Objects 
(compared by its Comparator<T> method).

A List in Java is a collection which doesn't preserve the order, 
nor the uniqueness of Objects.

As so, the **add** method when applied with a Set will compare 
the newcomers with the added Object. Thus, the Set will not be 
the same as before. The List, however, will preserve all elements 
be4 and after.
