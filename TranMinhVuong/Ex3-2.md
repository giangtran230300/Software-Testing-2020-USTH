The inheritance hierachy has a deep influence on testing of each individual class. Due to each subclass may has different methods, one must test each of them individually
hence reducing the Observability. At the same time,the inheritance hierachy can also has a huge impact on Controllability. A change in a superclass will result in a change
in every other subclasses,therefore,will result in the modification of every test case of the subclasses.
