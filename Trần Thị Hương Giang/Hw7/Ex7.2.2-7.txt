(a) p2 and p3 are test paths. p1 does not terminate at a final node. p4 does not
start at an initial node. p5 includes an edge that does not exist in the graph (3, 2).

(b) TR Edge Pairs = { [1,2,1], [1,2,3], [1,3,1], [2,1,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], [3,1,3] }

(c) Set of test paths does not satisfy Edge-Pair Coverage: { [2,1,2], [3,1,3] }

(d) p3 does not directly tour the prime path. p3 does tour the prime path with the sidetrip [1,2,1]
