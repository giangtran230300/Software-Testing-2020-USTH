(b) T Node Coverage = {[1,4,8], [2,5,9,6,10], [3,7,10]}
Although T Node Coverage visits all nodes, T Node Coverage does not tour edges (1,5), (5,7), (6,1) and (3,6)

(c) T Edge Coverage = T Node Coverage U {[1,4,8], [3,6,2,5,8]}
Although T Edge Coverage tours all edges, T Edge Coverage does not tour prime paths [1,5,9,6,2], [2,5,9,6,2], [3,6,2,5,9], 
[2,6,10], [5,8,5,2,5], [5,1,6,9,6], [9,6,2,5,8], or [9,6,2,5,9]
