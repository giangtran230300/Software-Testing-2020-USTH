Answer question (a) or (b), but not both, depending on your background.
(a) If you do, or have, worked for a software development company, how much effort did your
testing / QA team put into each of the four test activities? (test design, automation,
execution, evaluation)
(b) If you have never worked for a software development company, which of the four test
activities do you think you are best qualified for? (test design, automation, execution,
evaluation)

b, I believe I'm best qualified for test execution because I don't have any experience working 
for a software development company and do software testing. Test execution is the most trivial
out of the four and required the least experience and usually done by intern as this can either
be automated or required manual labor.s
