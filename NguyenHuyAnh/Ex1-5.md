a/ 
1. findLast(): The iteration doesn't cover the index 0.
 for (int i=x.length-1; i >= 0; i--);
2. countPositive(): The condition includes 0 as positive number when its not
  if (x[i] > 0)
  {
	count++
  }

3. OddorPos(): 
  if (x[i]%2 == 1 || x[i] > 0)
   {
            count++;
  }

b/ 

Test case for findLast() int[] x = {1,2,3} and y = 2
Test case for countPositive() int[] x = {-2, 4, -6}
Test case for oddOrPos() int[] x = {1, 2, 3}

c/ 
Test case for findLast() int[] x = {1, 1, 1} and y = 1
Test case for oddOrPos() int[] x = {1, 2, 3}

d/ 
Each input leads to errors also leading to failure. The reason is that error states cannot be corrected by further processing. If there is a negative value in x, all subsequent states (after processing the negative value) will be an error status no matter what else is in x.

e/ Input: x = [-3, -2, 0, 1, 4]
   Expected Output: 3
   Actual Output: 2
