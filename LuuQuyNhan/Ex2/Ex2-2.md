b. If you have never worked for a software development company,
which of the four test activities do you think you are best
qualified for? (test design, automation, execution, evaluation)

If I would be able to qualify for one of 4 test activities, I would choose execution. I believe that the execution test is the easiest one because it only requires basic computer skills. Testers only have to run tests and record results.
