2. Give a one-to-two paragraph explanation for how the inheritance
hierarchy can affect controllability and observability.

A profound heritage tree may become more difficult to check because the classes depend on the parent, i.e. if you alter or update anything in the super-class, it affects your respective students, meaning that each check affected by the alteration should be modified in sub-classes. At the other hand, it impacts observability as a lot of sub classes have to be studied that do the same job as the super class.
