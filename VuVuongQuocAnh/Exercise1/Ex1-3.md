# 1-3. #

----------
- "Level 3 thinking is that the purpose of testing is
to reduce risk" is the process of reduce faults to reduce the bad effects of them in the future.
- Risk here can be:

	
	- The resources using to debugging.
	- The reduce of benefits obtained from the program.

- The risk can never be reduce to zero since there is impossible to test all the test cases.
