# 1-5. #

----------
**a.**

1. The program will never reach the first element of the array. Fix:
	
		for (int i = x.length-1; x >= 0; x--)

2. The program will return the first index of zero. Fix:
		
		for (int i = x.length-1; x >= 0; x--)

3. The program will count 0 as positive. Fix:

		if (x[i] > 0)

4. The program will not count the odd negative numbers. Fix: 

		if (x[i] % 2 == -1 || x[i] > 0)

**b.** In the four given program, there is no way to not execute the fault since the fault is in the code that will always be executed with any test case.

**c.** 

1. x = [1, 1, 5]; y = 5;
2. x = [0];
3. x = [2, 2, 2];
4. x = [-2, -4, 2, 4];

**d.**

1. x = [2, 3, 1]; y = 5;
2. x = [0, 1, 1];
3. Cannot since the error here always lead to the failure.
4. Cannot since the error here always lead to the failure.

**e.**

1. x = [2, 3, 5]; y = 2; i = 0; PC = "return -1"
2. x = [0, 1, 0]; i = 0; PC = "i < x.length"
3. x = [-4, 2, 0, 2]; i = 2; count = 2; PC = "i++"
4. x = [-3, -2, 0, 1, 4]; i = 0; count = 0; PC = "i++"
