----------
**a.**

1. The method clone() inside class Truck cannot use the clone() method of class Vehicle. Fix: 

		@Override public Object clone() {
      		Object result = new Vehicle(this.y);
      		return result;
   		}

2. Fault is the inconsistency between methods compareTo() and equals(). Fix: Override one of them.

3. Fault is the inconsistency between superclass and subclass. Fix: Override one of them.
