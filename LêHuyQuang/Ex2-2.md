2-2,
#Question b: If you have never worked for a software development company, 
which of the four test activities do you think you are best qualified for? (test design, automation, execution, evaluation)

#Answer:

-I think I am best qualified for Testing Execution.

-The Test Execution is the process of running tests on the software and recording the results, 
and it required basic computer skills, and can often be assigned to interns of employees with little technical background 
so i can basically do all of it well.Also, all the test can be automated or can be run by hand.  
Hand-executed tests require the tester to be meticulous with bookkeeping and i'm very good at it, 
but hand execute tests wastes a valuable resource and it's may become very tidous job. 
However, in my opinion, it's a good start when i have never worked for a software development company.
