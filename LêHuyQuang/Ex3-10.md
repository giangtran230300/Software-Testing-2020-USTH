- Replace each occurrence of a set with a list:

@Theory
   public void removeThenAddDoesNotChangeList
                   (List<String> list, String string)  
   {
      assumeTrue (list != null);            
      assumeTrue (list.contains (string));  
      List<String> copy = new ArrayList<String>(list);   
      copy.remove (string);                       
      copy.add (string);
      assertTrue (list.equals (copy));      
    }

- The resulting theory is invalid
- The test that pass the precondition is 4 but the test that pass the precondition also the postcondition is 1.
- The reason is the list is changed, we just changed the position in the list and that make the list is changed.
