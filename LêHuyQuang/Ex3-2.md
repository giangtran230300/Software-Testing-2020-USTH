3-2,

- Inheritance tree of classes could become more complex to test, because the sub classes are dependent of its father.
- This affects controllability because we will need to control every super class and its sub classes, 
and if wee have a deep inheritance tree, it will be very complicated.
- On the other hand, it affects observability 
because we need to observe a large number of sub classes that actually are doing the same work as the super class.
