# Ex 3-5
In term of RIPR, in my opinion the test only have a small 
aw at the assertTrue
part. First of all, the test can reach the fault location since the test include all
the method that its need, by that, if its reach the fault location its will also
infects the incorrect program states however the 
aw is that it can not reveal all
the wrong behaviour of the programs. The checking method of the test is quite
bad since its only check the first elements of the list names, which mean that
every elements behind it follow an order that we don't know. This also mean
that the test can't propagate final state of the program and the wrong behavior
of its. This lead to the fact that not all the fault ( if its actual have ) can be
revealed.
