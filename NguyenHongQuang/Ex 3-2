Inheritance is a strong software design mechanism. How-
ever its complicated the testing ability. To be able to con-
trol a class with inheritance trait, we need to control every
sub-class and super-class of it. Same thing with observ-
ability, the apply of inheritance only makes its harder to
observe the behaviour of the class since the class not only
depend on them-self, they also depend on their super-class
or sub-class.
