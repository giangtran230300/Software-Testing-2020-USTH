# Homework 1
## Exercise 5

### Program 1

```java
/**
* Find last index of element
* 
*  @param x array to search
*  @param y value to look for
*  @return last index of y in x; -1 if absent
*  @throws NullPointerException if x is null
*/
public static int findLast (int[] x, int y)
{ 
  // As the example in the book points out, this loop should end at 0.
   for (int i=x.length-1; i > 0; i--)
   {
      if (x[i] == y)
      {
         return i;
      }
   }
   return -1;
}
```

#### Explain what is wrong with the given code. Describe the fault precisely by proposing a modification to the code

The given code intended to return the last index of a value y in an array x. However, the code does not look for the value y in the 0 index of x.  
A modification to the code:

```java
public static int findLast (int[] x, int y)
{ 
  // As the example in the book points out, this loop should end at 0.
   for (int i=x.length-1; i >= 0; i--) // change made here
   {
      if (x[i] == y)
      {
         return i;
      }
   }
   return -1;
}
```

#### If possible, give a test case that does not execute the fault. If not, briefly explain why not

Test case:
x = [4,2,3,1]  
y = 2

#### If possible, give a test case that executes the fault, but does not result in an error state. If not, briefly explain why not

x = [1,1,1]
y = 1

#### If possible give a test case that results in an error, but not a failure. If not, briefly explain why not. Hint: Don’t forget about the program counter

### Program 2

```java
   /**
   * Find LAST index of zero
   *
   * @param x array to search
   * @return index of last 0 in x; -1 if absent
   * @throws NullPointerException if x is null
   */
   public static int lastZero (int[] x)
   {
      for (int i = 0; i < x.length; i++)
      {
         if (x[i] == 0)
         {
            return i;
         }
      }
      return -1;
   }
```

#### Explain what is wrong with the given code. Describe the fault precisely by proposing a modification to the code

This program intended to return the last index of 0 in an array x. However, it returns the index of the first 0 found.  
A modification to the code:  

```java
public static int lastZero (int[] x)
   {
      for (int i = 0; i < x.length; i++)
      {
         if (x[i] == 0)
         {
            pos0 = i;
         }
      }
      if(pos0 != null){
      	return pos0;
      }
      return -1;
   }
```

#### If possible, give a test case that does not execute the fault. If not, briefly explain why not. 

x = [0, 1, 2]

#### If possible, give a test case that executes the fault, but does not result in an error state. If not, briefly explain why not.

#### If possible give a test case that results in an error, but not a failure. If not, briefly explain why not. Hint: Don’t forget about the program counter.

## Program 3

```java
   /** 
   * Counts positive elements in array
   *
   * @param x array to search
   * @return number of positive elements in x
   * @throws NullPointerException if x is null
   */
   public static int countPositive (int[] x)
   {
      int count = 0;

      for (int i=0; i < x.length; i++)
      {
         if (x[i] >= 0)
         {
            count++;
         }
      }
      return count;
   }
```

#### Explain what is wrong with the given code. Describe the fault precisely by proposing a modification to the code

This program intended to count positive elements of an array x. However, it also counts 0.  
A modification to the code:  

```java
public static int countPositive (int[] x)
   {
      int count = 0;

      for (int i=0; i < x.length; i++)
      {
         if (x[i] > 0)
         {
            count++;
         }
      }
      return count;
   }
```

#### If possible, give a test case that does not execute the fault. If not, briefly explain why not

x = [-1, 1, -2]

#### If possible, give a test case that executes the fault, but does not result in an error state. If not, briefly explain why not

#### If possible give a test case that results in an error, but not a failure. If not, briefly explain why not. Hint: Don’t forget about the program counter

### Program 4

```java
  /**
   * Count odd or positive elements in an array
   *
   * @param x array to search
   * @return count of odd or positive elements in x
   * @throws NullPointerException if x is null
   */
   public static int oddOrPos (int[] x)
   {  // Effects:  if x is null throw NullPointerException
      // else return the number of elements in x that
      //      are either odd or positive (or both)
      int count = 0;

      for (int i = 0; i < x.length; i++)
      {
         if (x[i]%2 == 1 || x[i] > 0)
         {
            count++;
         }
      }
      return count;
   }
```

#### Explain what is wrong with the given code. Describe the fault precisely by proposing a modification to the code

This program intended to count positive and odd elements of an array x. However, it also counts 0.  
A modification to the code: 

```java
if (x[i] > 0)
{
  count++;
}
else
{
  if (x[i]%2 ==1 ) count++;
}
```

#### If possible, give a test case that does not execute the fault. If not, briefly explain why not.

x = [1, 1, 2]

#### If possible, give a test case that executes the fault, but does not result in an error state. If not, briefly explain why not
x = [1, 2, 3]

### If possible give a test case that results in an error, but not a failure. If not, briefly explain why not. Hint: Don’t forget about the program counter
