## Exercise 3

*level 3 thinking is that the purpose of testing is
to reduce risk*

The "risk" here mean the possibility of software failure. Althought in testing, we always try to keep the failure probability as lowest as possible, the risk usually cannot be zero, since the software is being developed and growing day by day, eliminating all the risks is usually impossible. Moreover, there may have some risk that is rarely to happen but to avoid it may cost a lot.
