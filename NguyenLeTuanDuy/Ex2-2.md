## Exercise 2

I will be best qualified test automation.

Automation can help in many areas, most often to relieve the tester from repetitive, mechanical tasks. Checking of testing criteria can be automated through instrumentation, which allows a higher level of testing to be performed. Automation will always run into undecidable problems, such as infeasible paths, test case generation, internal variables, etc. Automation cannot help validate output or make creative decisions.

Since I find myself good at problem-solving and logical thinking, automation testing seems best suitable for me.
