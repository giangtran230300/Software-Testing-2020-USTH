- What do we mean by “level 3 thinking is that the purpose of testing is to reduce risk?”
- What risk?
- Can we reduce the risk to zero?
```
Answer:
```
- The purpose of testing is to reduce the risk because there are always more bugs, faults in the future. So that we should find errors as soon as possible and as much as possible.
- The risk are about the cost of the application and the pressure of the coder/developer.
- It's hard to find every single bugs/errors but it's possible.
