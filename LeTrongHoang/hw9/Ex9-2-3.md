Question
```
Answer questions (a) through (d) for the mutant on line 6 in the method sum().
(a)窶オf possible, find test inputs that do not reach the mutant.
(b)窶オf possible, find test inputs that satisfy reachability but not infection for the mutant.
(c)窶オf possible, find test inputs that satisfy infection, but not propagation for the mutant.
(d)窶オf possible, find test inputs that strongly kill the mutants.
```

sum()
```java
public static int sum(int[] x){
    int s=0;
    for (int i=0; i<x.length; i++){
        s = s + x[i];
        // s = s - x[i];
    }
    return s;
}
```

Answer
```
(a) sum: If x is null or the empty array, ie x = null or [], then the mutant is never
reached.

(b) sum: Any input with all zeroes will reach but not infect. Examples are: x = [0] or [0, 0].

(c) sum: Any input with nonzero entries, but with a sum of zero, is fine. Examples are: x = [1, -1] or [1, -3, 2].

(d) sum: Any inputs with a nonzero sum works. Here's an example: x = [1, 5, 9].
