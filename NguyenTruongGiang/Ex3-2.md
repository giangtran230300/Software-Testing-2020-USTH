# Exercise 2 - Chapter 3

> Give a one-to-two paragraph explanation for how the inheritance hierarchy can affect controllability and observability.

## Answer
A long, complex inheritance tree with multiple subclasses can greatly affect controllability and observability. Since the subclasses are dependent on the parent class, if we make changes to a parent class, its subclasses will also be affected. We also have to keep track of a lot of subclasses, therefore affects observability.
