# Exercise 5 - Chapter 3

```java
@Test
public void testSort()
{
	names.add("Laura");
	names.add("Han");
	names.add("Alex");
	names.add("Ashley");
	names.sort();
	asserTrue("Sort method", names.getFirst().equals("Alex"));
}
```

## Answer
The flaw in the test program is that it only test if the first item is sorted. The other 3 items is not verified.

### RIPR model
- Reachability: The fault is reached if the first element is sorted incorrectly.  
- Infection: If the fault is reached.
- Propagation: The final state is not checked so propagation is not achieved. For example, the program can have the first item sorted correctly while the other 3 is not.
- Revealability: The test can reveal the error if the the first item is sorted incorrectly.
