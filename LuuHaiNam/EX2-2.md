2. Answer question (a) or (b), but not both, depending on your background.
(a) If you do, or have, worked for a software development company, how much effort did your
testing / QA team put into each of the four test activities? (test design, automation,
execution, evaluation)
(b) If you have never worked for a software development company, which of the four test
activities do you think you are best qualified for? (test design, automation, execution,
evaluation)

Answer:
(b)
i think i may best qualified at Test Execution because:
-This is easy â€“ and trivial if the tests are well automated
-Requires basic computer skills
-Interns
-Employees with no technical background
-Asking qualified test designers to execute tests is a sure way to convince them to look for a development job
-If, for example, GUI tests are not well automated, this requires a lot of manual labor
-Test executors have to be very careful and meticulous with bookkeeping
