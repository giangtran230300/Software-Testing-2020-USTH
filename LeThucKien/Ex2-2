a) If you do, or have, worked for a software development company, how much effort did your testing / QA team put into each of the four test activities? (test design, automation, execution, evaluation) 

No i haven't.

b) If you have never worked for a software development company, which of the four test activities do you think you are best qualified for? (test design, automation, execution, evaluation)

I think it is a really important part evaluation will tell you how good your software after all other test, evaluation will give the tester easiest idea to how to improve the test since evaluation is the most important of four test.
