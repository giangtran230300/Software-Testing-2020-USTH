1. Chapter 3 contained the program Calc.java. It is available on the program listings page on the book website. Calc currently implements one function: it adds two integers. Use test-driven design to add additional functionality to subtract two integers, multiply two integers, and divide two integers. First create a failing test for one of the new functionalities, modify the class until the test passes, then perform any refactoring needed. Repeat until all of the required functionality has been added to your new version of Calc, and all tests pass. Remember that in TDD, the tests determine the requirements. This means you must encode decisions such as whether the division method returns an integer or a floating point number in automated tests before modifying the software. Submit printouts of all tests, your final version of Calc, and a screenshot showing that all tests pass. Most importantly, include a narrative describing each TDD test created, the changes needed to make it pass, and any refactoring that was necessary.

- The Calc.java after adding additional functionalities:
~~~java
package com.company;  
  
public class Calc {  
    static public int add (int a, int b)  
    {  
        return a + b;  
  }  
  
    static public int sub (int a, int b)  
    {  
        return a - b;  
  }  
  
    static public int mul (int a, int b)  
    {  
        return a * b;  
  }  
  
    static public int div (int a, int b)  
    {  
        return a / b;  
  }  
}
~~~

- The test for the functionalities:
~~~java
package com.company;  
  
import org.junit.*;  
import static org.junit.Assert.*;  
  
  
public class CalcTest {  
    @Test  
  public void testAdd(){  
        assertTrue ("add failed", 3 == Calc.add(1,2));  
  }  
  
    @Test  
  public void testSub(){  
        assertTrue ("sub failed", 3 == Calc.sub(5,2));  
  }  
  
    @Test  
  public void testMul(){  
        assertTrue ("mul failed", 6 == Calc.mul(2,3));  
  }  
  
    @Test  
  public void testDiv(){  
        assertTrue ("div failed", 4.5 == Calc.div(9,2));  
  }  
}
~~~
- Now we run the test and here is the results:

- Here the division (div) test failed since the method returns results as integers, while our test requires the results should be floating point numbers.
- So we have to refactor the div() method to:
~~~java
    static public float div (float a, float b)  
    {  
        return a / b;  
  }
~~~
- Now if we run the tests again:

- All the test has passed.
