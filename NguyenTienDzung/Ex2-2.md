## Question b

If you have never worked for a software development company,
which of the four test activities do you think you are best qualified for? (Test design, automation, execution, evaluation)

## Answer

- I think i will be best qualified for test design because i am not the one who is very good in programming to qualified for automation.

- Test design is the outline of the cases in test case. It shows test opinion and is brief, easy to understand so it seems to be suitable for the guys like me.
